# Requirements Document

## Introduction

프로젝트의 안정성과 유지보수성을 보장하기 위해 포괄적인 자동화된 테스트 시스템과 CI/CD 파이프라인을 구축합니다. 이를 통해 코드 품질을 유지하고 배포 과정을 자동화하여 개발 효율성을 높입니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive automated testing, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN unit tests SHALL run automatically and pass
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN integration tests SHALL verify request/response contracts
3. WHEN UI components are modified THEN component tests SHALL validate rendering and interactions
4. WHEN AI services are updated THEN end-to-end tests SHALL verify image generation and recommendation flows

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated code quality checks, so that the codebase maintains consistent standards and catches issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN linting SHALL check for code style violations
2. WHEN TypeScript code is written THEN type checking SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN test coverage is measured THEN it SHALL meet minimum threshold requirements
4. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the build SHALL fail with clear reporting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want continuous integration pipeline, so that code changes are automatically validated before merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pull requests are created THEN all tests SHALL run automatically
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the PR SHALL be blocked from merging
3. WHEN builds succeed THEN deployment artifacts SHALL be automatically created
4. WHEN multiple environments exist THEN each SHALL have appropriate test suites

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment pipeline, so that validated code changes can be deployed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is merged to main branch THEN it SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
2. WHEN staging tests pass THEN production deployment SHALL be triggered with approval
3. WHEN deployments fail THEN automatic rollback SHALL be initiated
4. WHEN deployments succeed THEN health checks SHALL verify system functionality
