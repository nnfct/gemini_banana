# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 단일 프로젝트로 구성된 AI 가상 피팅 시스템을 백엔드와 프론트엔드로 분리하여 독립적인 개발, 배포, 확장이 가능하도록 구조를 개선합니다. 이를 통해 유지보수성을 높이고 새로운 기능 추가를 용이하게 합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have separate backend and frontend projects, so that I can develop and deploy them independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the backend SHALL be in a separate directory with its own package.json
2. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the frontend SHALL be in a separate directory with its own package.json
3. WHEN either backend or frontend is modified THEN the other SHALL continue to function without requiring changes
4. WHEN deploying THEN each service SHALL be deployable independently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear API contracts between frontend and backend, so that I can maintain consistent communication interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are defined THEN they SHALL have clear request/response schemas
2. WHEN API changes are made THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained or versioned
3. WHEN frontend makes API calls THEN it SHALL use standardized error handling
4. WHEN new APIs are added THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular backend architecture, so that I can easily add new features without affecting existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend is structured THEN it SHALL have separate modules for routes, services, and utilities
2. WHEN new AI services are added THEN they SHALL follow the same interface pattern
3. WHEN database integration is needed THEN it SHALL be easily pluggable without major refactoring
4. WHEN environment configurations change THEN they SHALL be centrally managed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable frontend components, so that I can quickly build new features with consistent UI patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are created THEN they SHALL be modular and reusable
2. WHEN new pages are added THEN they SHALL use existing component library
3. WHEN styling changes are needed THEN they SHALL be applied through a centralized theme system
4. WHEN state management is required THEN it SHALL follow consistent patterns across components
