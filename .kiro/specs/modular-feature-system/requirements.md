# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 시스템에 플러그인 방식의 모듈형 기능 시스템을 구축하여 새로운 AI 서비스, UI 컴포넌트, API 엔드포인트를 쉽게 추가할 수 있도록 합니다. 이를 통해 지속적인 기능 확장이 용이한 아키텍처를 구현합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a plugin-based architecture for AI services, so that I can easily add new AI providers without modifying core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new AI service is added THEN it SHALL implement a standard interface
2. WHEN AI services are registered THEN they SHALL be automatically discoverable by the system
3. WHEN switching between AI providers THEN the application SHALL work without code changes
4. WHEN AI service fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative providers

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular API endpoints, so that I can add new features without touching existing route handlers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new API modules are created THEN they SHALL be automatically registered with the router
2. WHEN API modules are added THEN they SHALL follow consistent middleware patterns
3. WHEN API endpoints are defined THEN they SHALL have automatic validation and documentation
4. WHEN API modules are removed THEN the system SHALL continue to function normally

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a component registry system, so that I can dynamically load UI components based on configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components are registered THEN they SHALL be available for dynamic loading
2. WHEN page layouts are configured THEN they SHALL automatically render registered components
3. WHEN components have dependencies THEN they SHALL be resolved automatically
4. WHEN components are updated THEN they SHALL hot-reload in development mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want feature flags and configuration management, so that I can control feature rollout and system behavior without code deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN features are developed THEN they SHALL be controllable via feature flags
2. WHEN configurations change THEN they SHALL be applied without server restart
3. WHEN feature flags are toggled THEN the UI SHALL reflect changes immediately
4. WHEN A/B testing is needed THEN features SHALL support percentage-based rollout
