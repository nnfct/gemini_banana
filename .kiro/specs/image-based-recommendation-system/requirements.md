# Requirements Document

## Introduction

사용자가 업로드한 이미지를 기반으로 유사한 패션 아이템을 추천하는 시스템을 개발합니다. 현재 시스템은 키워드 매칭 기반의 단순한 추천을 제공하고 있으나, 이를 시각적 유사성 기반의 고도화된 추천 시스템으로 발전시킵니다. Azure Cognitive Services 또는 로컬 Python 벡터 임베딩을 활용하여 이미지의 시각적 특징을 분석하고, 이미지를 서버에 저장하지 않고 URL 기반으로 처리하는 효율적인 시스템을 구축합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload an image and receive visually similar fashion item recommendations, so that I can find products that match my style preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image THEN the system SHALL analyze the image using computer vision technology
2. WHEN the image analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL return a list of visually similar fashion items from the catalog
3. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL show similarity scores for each recommended item
4. IF the uploaded image contains multiple clothing items THEN the system SHALL identify and recommend items for each category separately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to support both Azure Cognitive Services and local Python vector embedding options, so that I can choose the most suitable solution based on cost and performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Azure Cognitive Services is configured THEN the system SHALL use Azure Computer Vision API for image analysis
2. WHEN Azure is not available THEN the system SHALL fallback to local Python-based vector embedding processing
3. WHEN using local processing THEN the system SHALL utilize pre-trained models like CLIP or ResNet for feature extraction
4. IF both options are available THEN the system SHALL allow configuration-based selection between Azure and local processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to process images via URL without storing them on the server, so that I can maintain user privacy and reduce storage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL process it in memory without saving to disk
2. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL immediately dispose of the image data
3. WHEN using external services THEN the system SHALL pass image data as base64 or temporary URLs
4. IF image processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive categorized recommendations (tops, bottoms, shoes, accessories), so that I can easily find the type of items I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system analyzes an uploaded image THEN it SHALL categorize detected clothing items by type
2. WHEN returning recommendations THEN the system SHALL group results by category (top, pants, shoes, accessories)
3. WHEN multiple categories are detected THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for each category
4. IF no specific category is detected THEN the system SHALL provide general fashion recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the recommendation system to be fast and responsive, so that I can get results quickly without long waiting times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL begin processing within 1 second
2. WHEN using Azure services THEN the system SHALL return results within 5 seconds
3. WHEN using local processing THEN the system SHALL return results within 10 seconds
4. IF processing takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators to the user

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to have proper error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that users always receive a response even when primary services fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Azure services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to local processing
2. WHEN local processing fails THEN the system SHALL return keyword-based recommendations as a last resort
3. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details for debugging
4. IF all processing methods fail THEN the system SHALL return a user-friendly error message with suggested actions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see detailed information about recommended items including price, brand, and availability, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are displayed THEN each item SHALL show title, price, and similarity score
2. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL display brand information and product images
3. WHEN items have special offers THEN the system SHALL highlight discounts or promotions
4. IF an item is out of stock THEN the system SHALL indicate availability status
